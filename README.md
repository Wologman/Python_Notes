# Python_Notes
Markdown files from my Obsidian Vault.  My interests include a lot more than just programming, and even the programming is typically in multiple platforms/operating systems/languages/purposes/styles/frameworks, so it gets confusing. I started programming in 1994, in PASCAL. 

I've reinvented then forgotten these wheels so many times I want to write them up more thoroughly, follow consistant practices instead of searching SO posts and official docs so often.
