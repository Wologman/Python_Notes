# Python_Notes
Markdown files from my Obsidian Vault, not perfect on GitHub.  My interests include a lot more than just programming, and even the programming is typically in multiple platforms/OS/languages/purposes/styles & frameworks, so I forget things sometimes.  I started with leaning Pascal in 1994.

I've written some of this up in my own words so I can follow more consistant practices & spend less time trying to follow SO posts and official docs.
