TODO

- Understand the best way to setup VScode, and .env file use so that the linting, code completion, library imports work, in general, and for QGIS.

- Understand more about python envonments

- Understand how to setup VScode so that I can run QGIS commands stand-alone
	What do I mean by this?
		- Run QGIS processing commands.  (So somehow this is using the QGIS API)
		- Run SAGA, GRASS, GDAL commands, directly? No need for QGIS?
		- Perform GeoPandas operations, possibly in the same conda environment

- Master OOP concepts so I can use them on new projects & also be more comfortable with Pytorch

- Setup a template workspace for python development.  And remember how to use the ipython window, examine variables etc.   I should probably do a refresher VSCode course.

- Build up a base of consistant code for my most common problems

- Finish writing up or learning the other topics in the file list
